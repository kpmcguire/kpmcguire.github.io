## You might not need jQuery...

I've heard about this before, sure. It's kind of *de rigueur* these days to trash jQuery, or at least look down on people that use it. It's pretty practical, though, and in my experience, almost every project still includes it. So I never learned how to not use it.

Recently, though, I decided to give it a shot. I wrote up some stuff in jQuery, and thought maybe I could at least write the slow parts (loops?) in plain js to see if it's speedier.

What I learned, though, was that it's easier than I thought to do all the things jQuery does in plain js.

I discovered a few cool resources that made this easier. 

* [PlainJS][plainjs] 
* [jQuery to Vanilla JS][vanilla]

Basically, I just walked through each section of my jQuery code, looked up the Plain JS equivalent, and replaced it. Sometimes it was a little wonky, but I managed to work through it. Plus, now I understand more of what's going on under the covers.
