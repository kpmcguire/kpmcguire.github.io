## Welcome to.. your perfect score sheet

I finished working on the thing I was talking about in the [last post][last_post], which is a Javascript version of the scoresheet for the game "[Welcome to... Your Perfect Home][welcome_to]".

I was playing it with friends, and the box says that you can download an app instead of using paper. I checked it out, but the app is android only. Which I found extremely confusing, but anyway, someone suggested that they should've made a web version of it, so I did.

Additionally, I decided to try to write this in plain Javascript, instead of relying on jQuery. as I said in the previous post, this is definitely something I should've tried sooner, I really enjoyed it.

[Try it out!][try_it]
