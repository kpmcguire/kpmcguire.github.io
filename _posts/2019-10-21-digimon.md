## Digimon - Pocket Monsters

[Check out the "game"][game]

I've been working on a project to be able to show off my skills with VueJs. It's really, really stupid, and here's why.

### Free APIs

When I started this project, I really wanted to build it against a third party API. I thought about making my own, but as I said, I really just wanted to concentrate on the VueJS side of things, so I thought that would be a distraction. I started looking at the various free apis out there. I had heard of the [PokeAPI][pokeapi], and a [Star Wars API][starwarsapi]. Neither of these really appealed to me, since I'm not a small child. (Yes, Star Wars is for children. Don't @ me.) I did find a [Star Trek API][startrekapi], which appeals to me more. I thought I would use that in some way.

### Let's play a game

I wanted this project to be very simple. I thought a little game would be fun. For example, who would win in a fight? Miles O'Brien, or Geordi LaForge? It would be simple to pull up their profiles and display some info about them, and pick a random characteristic, say, like, their age or # of episodes, and whoever has the highest whatever, "wins". 

The Star Trek API, though, didn't provide images. I thought I could easily write some JS to retrieve the first DuckDuckGo image search result. This is probably pretty simple, and it's somehting I would like to try in the future, but it was taking me longer than I had liked, so I decided to go back to the drawing board, and use my fake game idea with a different API that already provides pictures.

### Enter the Digimon
So, that brought me back to the PokeAPI. It provides image URLs. 

At this point, I need to say that I don't like Pokemon. I understand if you do, that's fine. I think some of the monsters are cute, I enjoy some of the artwork. But it's just not for me. I'm an adult, and it's for kids.

And as a kid, I played a lot of console RPGs, like Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, etc. When Pokemon started getting popular in the states, I tried it, since it's pretty much a RPG. But.... I was like, 17 at the time, and I found it really boring. It wasn't very much fun, I thought, and it was squarely aimed at much younger kids. So I never really cared about it. 

~20 years later or so, and Pokemon has only gotten bigger as people younger than me have started to grow up? I guess. I don't even really know. Also, did I mention, that I SO DO NOT CARE. I tried Pokemon Go. It's very boring. Whatever.

So, given that I kind of hate pokemon, and I had committed to using the PokeAPI, I had to make it somewhat interesting for myself. So, I decided to make something that I would imagine would infuriate Pokemon fans. 

Firstly, Digimon. As little as I know about Pokemon, I know even less about Digimon. I imagined it to be sort of like the Pepsi to Pokemon's Coke. So, right of the bat, I put the Digimon logo at the top of the page, and I felt like I was on the right track.

### She's so heavy

So, in Pokemon, certain monsters have traits, something like elemental abilities. A water-type Pokemon will do a lot of damage to a fire-type. (I think). Since the PokeAPI provides the abilities, I can easily display them when the Pokemon battle each other. But it does nothing at all. It's just smoke and mirrors.

If you're a Pokemon fan, I imagine you would know what the types are of the Pokemon I'm displaying. If you have a fire-type vs a water-type, you would be smart to bet on the water type. But, that's not really how my game works. It's purely a size-based contest. The heaviest pokemon wins. This was easy to achieve, since weight is exposed in the API.

My hope is that this will confuse and upset anyone who plays my game and knows anything at all about Pokemon.

And, I did really learn a lot about VueJS. So I managed to do what I set out to - learn something and mildly troll pokemon fans.
