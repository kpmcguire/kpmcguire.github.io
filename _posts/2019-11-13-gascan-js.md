## Gascan

I rewrote/created a gas milage tracking app using Vuejs called [Gascan][app]. This was necessary mainly because I am a cheapskate.

### The Django Version

A few months ago, I created a gas milage tracking app using Django. I had just recently started learning how to use Python, and I thought this would be a good project to learn with.

It was ok. I learned that Django is fine, (not amazing, kind of annoying, but fine) and that Python really sucks when it comes to package management, which is not exactly a [unique][xkcd] [opinion][hn].

So, I got the app working. [Check out the Django version of Gascan][djangogascan]. I think it was pretty well executed. It has a simple email based sign up. You can register multiple cars, and each one can have many "fillups", and the app calculates the gas milage. Pretty much exactly what I wanted.

### But why?

I have an aging Honda Fit. It gets pretty good gas milage, but it seemed like it was getting worse. I started tracking it in apple notes.

This was also fine. But here's what usually happened. I'm at a gas station. There's usually a lot of people. I feel pressure to get out of there as quickly as possible. So I generally just write down the odometer and the gallons of gas, and get out there, leaving the calculation for later. Which almost never did.

To me, this seemed like a perfect opportunity to try creating an app. The calculation is simple, but it would be nice if it happened automatically, something a computer is good at doing.

Plus, A few years ago, I was looking for gas milage apps on the app store. They all kind of sucked, and they all had ads. So I thought it would be a good excuse to try making my own.

Back to the present day. So I had my gas milage app. I had my phone. Unfortunately, I also had Heroku. Heroku is great. I've used them before for lots of things and I've always been impressed with everything they do. 

However, their ~30 second waiting time for the free app tier was basically making it so I pretty much never actually used my app, because the loading time seemed much longer when I'm sitting at the gas station, waiting for the app to wake up. I know that I could have solved this problem by throwing money at heroku, but, remember, I am a cheapskate, and I didn't want to pay the heroku hobby price.

### Just do it in JavaScript

After my [last project][pokemon], I knew I could create a free app using Netlify that wouldn't have the same 30 second wake up period. Also, I have been using vue.js, and I thought this would be easy to recreate using that.

### Ace of Database

But, you're thinking to yourself, "Hey idiot, you won't have any data persistence without some kind of backend", and you'd be right. Using this approach meant I had to come up with some other way to store the fillup data.

I decided that localstorage would be good enough for my purposes. I don't think that I really need to persist this data over long periods of time. Basically, this will stick around until I get a new phone or clear out my browser. 

The way I see it, tracking your gas milage doesn't really need to always have complete data integrity. Generally, I get a feeling that my car is running poorly, and I want to see if it's in my head or of it's really true. So, over the next month or so, I can track my gas milage. Then, if I want to do it again, sure, I guess it'd be nice to know what it was last year, but in my mind, it's really about what's happing in a smaller clusters of time.

Plus, if I really want to make this more robust, I can try to figure out some kind of way to keep this data around so it's not just stuck on my phone - but I can do that later. 

So, I went ahead and did it in vue, using localstorage. This also made it so you don't have to create user accounts. Which I think is a nice bonus.

### Midwest Can Company

When it came time to do the branding, I had already decided I wanted to call this thing "Gascan". I did a duckduckgo search for gas cans.

I really didn't like the look of this:

But I did like this:

![a cool vintage metal gascan](/assets/images/blog/vintage-gas-can.jpg)

I remember having one of those as a kid in the 80s. It looks so much cooler than the modern plastic ones, so I based the branding on that.

So now I have a gas milage tracking web app that loads pretty much instantly, and I can track my milage without waiting or paying any money to Heroku.
