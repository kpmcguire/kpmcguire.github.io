## Job applications suck

I wrote a single page app to show you the weather. Check it out -- [kpmweather][kpmweather-live]. 

Here's [kpmweather on github][kpmweather-github].

I did this as part of a job inteview -- that I did not get. However, I think it's pretty cool, so I took out the branding and now I'm reposting it.

It's not too complicated. It's a vuejs app that connects to the darksky api and shows you weather for you location. Also, you can search and see weather for any other location with postal codes or lat/long. (Try Antartica)
