## No good?

I've been working on a game. Try it out. It's not good yet. But it will get better.

Here's [the game on github][curb-github].

Here's [the game you can play in your browser][curb-live].

### Thoughts for the future:

- A mini-game where you stare down your enemy and the music from the show plays. 
- Leon.
- Complete golf minigame, at the country club, with black swan that you cannot kill.
- Larry can solve problems with money, but there's a constant balance between money and justice. Larry doesn't like spending money unless he feels like he's getting a fair shake. (Maybe just shooting everything with money is the easy way to beat the game, but you can't get the real ending unless you satisfy your sense of justice)
- There should be an essence of Larry being like the goose in untitled goose game, but not so much as to be derivative. Just Larry, wandering around LA, causing trouble.
