## No good?

I've been working on a game. Try it out. It's not good yet. But it will get better.

Here's [the game on github][curb-github].

Here's [the game you can play in your browser][curb-live].

This game is very incomplete. There's barely anything to do, some of the platforms are hard to reach, the double-jumping doesn't work if you're using a gamepad. But for the most part, there is a small core of everything I wanted to do.

My goal for this game is to make a very lightweight platforming/adventure style game based on the show Curb Your Enthusiasm. I think this will be easy to do, since a) I love this show, and 2) there's so many great episodes I can draw upon. Here are some random ideas:

- A level where you need to get a present for Ted Danson's birthday party. You find the perfect gift: Mondo Freaks. You end up getting chased out of the party for your poor taste.

- Susie will definitely be a boss. You will have to dodge the swear words coming out of her mouth.

- There will most certainly be a level where you are being chased by two women in wheelchairs.

- I can definitely see a whole series of levels where you have to gather the cast of Seinfeld for a reunion just to try to get Cheryl back.

- A mini-game where you stare down your enemy and the "staredown" music from the show plays, and you part ways, saying "ok".

- Leon.

- Complete golf minigame, at the country club, with black swan as a boss.

- Larry can solve problems with money, but there's a constant balance between money and social justice. Larry doesn't like spending money unless he feels like he's getting a fair shake. (Maybe just shooting everything with money is the easy way to beat the game, but you can't get the real ending unless you satisfy your sense of justice).

- There should be an essence of Larry being like the goose in untitled goose game, but not so much as to be derivative. Just Larry, wandering around LA, causing trouble.
