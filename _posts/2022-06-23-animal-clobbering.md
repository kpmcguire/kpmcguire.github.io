## It's (Animal) Clobberin' time

I made a new game/thing. This time, I used react. Check out the live version of the site - [Animal Clobbering](https://animal-clobbering.netlify.app).

### What the hell is this?

Good question. It's a weird game-like thing. I discovered the [ACNH Api](https://acnhapi.com) and I thought it would be fun to build something using it.

I am very fond of my old project, ["Pokemon" "Battler"](/2019/10/21/digimon.html), and I always wanted to do something that was similar, but a little bit more interactive. So this time, I thought, instead of a dumb fake game that's intended to amuse/piss people off, how about I make a real game?

So this "game", and I do mean to use those quotes quite deliberately, has multiple layers of nostalgia/inspiration involved.

- Basic JRPG combat, as in, say, Dragon Warrior I.
- Slay the spire - seeing what your opponent will do and reacting accordingly
- Earthbound - just straight up stole the [backgrounds](https://www.gjtorikian.com/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/) and sounds

I also really wanted to dig into react some more. It's definitely not the right platform to use if you actually want to make a real game, mainly because you have to navigate the async issues that come with setting state. 

But I did learn some stuff, and I think it's fun. Almost. At least it's getting close to approaching something that might be called fun.
