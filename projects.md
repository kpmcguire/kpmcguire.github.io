Here are some projects I've worked on.

## [Auto Accessible Color Picker][auto]

I made this because I felt like all the other accessible color pickers weren't very good. I like hue-based color pickers (similar to what you use in photohop). I thought it would be cool to have the app choose the color automatically. This is all possible because of the awesome [Tinycolor][tinycolor] library.

## [Ithaca Events Calendar][ithaca]

Another scratching my own itch kind of thing. Although this is still very much a work in progress, the main idea is to collect all the events from the various websites that publish these events and try to show only the highest quality events.

## [Gascan][gascangithub]

This is a Gas Mileage tracking app. I was doing this manually, and I realized I could pretty easily build this as a webapp to save myself from having to do the math. I built this with Django to familiarize myself with it.

## [Gascan JS][gascanjsgithub]

This is a JS gas mileage tracking app. I made this using VueJS. It exists because the version of the above Django Gascan was hosted on Heroku, which sleeps your free apps, and I wanted to have something that loaded immediately, so I used VueJS and Netlify.

## [Welcome to.. Your Perfect Score Sheet][welcometogithub]

A javascript verison of the scoresheet for the paper-based game ["Welcome To.. Your Perfect Home"][welcometopub] by Blue Cocker games. Handy if you run out of sheets. It tries to save your score, even if you reload the page, by using browser localStorage.

## [Pokemon Battler][pokemongithub]

A simple game. Pits two monsters against one another, and lets you wager on which one you think will win. If you can keep a streak going, you stand to make a lot of fake money.
